        "Secondly, we calculate clipped gradients by calling `gradient_computer.loss_and_clipped_gradients`. We pass our `train_loss_fn` and then arguments to be forward to `train_loss_fn`. The gradient computer will split the batch on per-example arguments (i.e. batch size will be 1) and call `train_loss_fn` for each example. The return gradients will be clipped and then averaged. `gradient_computer.loss_and_clipped_gradients` will return mean loss, network state (ignored in the example) and metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we have clipped the gradients and are ready to make an optimizer step. However, to make it differentially-private we also need to add noise to the gradients vector. We do that by calling `gradient_computer.add_noise_to_grads` where we pass gradient vector, noise PRNGKey, total batch size (i.e. total number of examples accumulated in the gradient since the last optimizer step) and the noise state. `gradient_computer.add_noise_to_grads` will return gradients vector with added noise, used standard deviation of the noise for monitoring purposes (ignored in our case) and new noise state that we have to save and pass in the next call.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then the rest of the code is the same as in the usual non-DP training: we calculate updated model weights by applying the calculating gradients with the help of optimizer and calculate the accuracy of predicions for monitoring purposes."
