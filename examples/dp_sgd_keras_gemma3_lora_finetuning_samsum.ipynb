        "Welcome to Jax Privacy for Keras! In this tutorial you will learn how to LoRA fine-tune [Gemma3 LLM](https://www.kaggle.com/models/keras/gemma3) in a differentially private (DP) way using [DP-SGD algorithm](https://medium.com/pytorch/differential-privacy-series-part-1-dp-sgd-algorithm-explained-12512c3959a3). We will fine-tune the model on the [SAMSum dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Samsung/samsum).\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform the full fine-tuning and reproduce the results we recommend using A100 GPU, ideally multiple (e.g. 8 or 16), to speed up the training process. You can obtain them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or in [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). For Gemma3 4b, the model we fine-tune in this tutorial, you need at least [16GB of memory in GPU](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core#sizes). If you don't have it you can use a smaller Gemma 1B model or enable mixed precision (see below).\n",
