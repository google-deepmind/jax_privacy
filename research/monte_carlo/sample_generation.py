"""Pure-JAX sampling of participation patterns for Monte Carlo accounting.

Each function draws the participation pattern of a *single* example under one of
the fixed-participation strategies in ``batch_selection``: an example
participates in exactly ``num_participations`` (K) of the ``iterations`` (T)
steps. Each sampler returns a pair ``(positions, poisson_mask)``: ``positions``
is a sorted length-K int array of the sampled iteration indices, and
``poisson_mask`` is a length-K boolean array marking which of those
participations survive Poisson subsampling (all True when ``sampling_prob ==
1``). Feed both to ``banded_c_times_pattern`` to form ``C @ x`` for the kept
participations.

These helpers deliberately handle a single example (no batch dimension); draw a
batch by mapping over PRNG keys, e.g.
``jax.vmap(sample_balanced_min_sep, in_axes=(0, None, None, None, None))``. The
size-determining arguments (``cycle_length``, ``num_participations``,
``iterations``, ``min_sep``, ``random_rotation``) are static and must be Python
scalars when the functions are jitted.
