# JAX-Privacy: Algorithms for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in JAX

[**Installation**](#installation)
| [**Reproducing Results**](#reproducing-results)
| [**Citing**](#citing)

This repository contains the JAX implementation of algorithms that we develop
in our research on privacy-preserving machine learning.
This research code is open-sourced with the main objective of
transparency and reproducibility, so (some) rough edges should be expected.

## Installation<a id="installation"></a>

**Note:** to ensure that your installation is compatible with your local
accelerators such as a GPU, we recommend to first follow the corresponding
instructions to install [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#install)
and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

### Option 1: Static Installation

This option is preferred for the purpose of re-using functionalities of our
codebase without modifying them.
The package can be installed by running the following command-line:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/deepmind/jax_privacy
```

### Option 2: Local Installation (Allowing Edits) <a id="install-option2"></a>

This option is preferred to either build on top of our codebase or to reproduce
our results.

* The first step is to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/jax_privacy
```

* Then the code can be installed so that local modifications to the code are
reflected in imports of the package:

```
cd jax_privacy
pip install -e .
```
