## Style guide

Code in this library generally follows the
[Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
We aim to keep APIs, names, and design patterns in line with the broader JAX
ecosystem as much as possible, with immutability and functional purity being a
key guiding principles we adhere to across our library. Below are some more
detailed conventions depending on what is being contributed.

1. **Public Facing Functions**: Public facing functions are those that are
exposed to the **users** of JAX Privacy (usually surfaced via \_\_init\_\_.py).
Public facing functions and classes should **always** have full docstrings, type
annotations, and example usages in the form of
[doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html). Doctests
provides useful documentation that stays up-to-date with code changes, and
is a useful litmus test on the simplicity and usability of the API surface.

1. **Internal functions used across files**: For maintainability of the core
library, it is sometimes beneficial to define a function in one file and have it
be used by another file within the jax_privacy package. These functions are not
intended to be consumed by JAX Privacy users (although may be encountered by
developers / contributors). These functions should generally have
descriptive names, type annotations. Internal functions should have a one-line
docstring explaining what they do. A full docstring is encouraged if the
function has non-obvious side effects, complex arguments,
or implements a multi-step algorithm that isn't clear from the code alone.

1. **File-local private functions**: These function should always have a
leading "_". This signals to developers that the function is not part of the
public API and is subject to change without notice. These functions should have
1-line docstrings; type annotations are optional and context-dependent. Example
usages are not needed as they can be found in the corresponding _test.py file.

1. **Nested functions**: Functions defined within other functions should
generally be as simple as possible; we prefer to keep the boilerplate minimal
on these (no docstrings + type annotations), inline comments can be used, but
should be used sparingly.
