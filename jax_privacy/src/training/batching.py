"""Virtual batching to allow easy accumulation across devices and steps.

Typical usage:
  batching = VirtualBatching(
      batch_size_init=128,
      batch_size_per_device_per_step=32,
      num_replicas=2,
  )
  update_step = 0

  # At each full step, the batch-size accumulated across devices is 32*2=64.
  batching.batch_size_per_step
  >>> 64
  # Thus in order to get a total batch-size of 128, we must accumulate over 2
  # steps before actually applying a model update.
  batching.apply_update_every(update_step)
  >>> 2
