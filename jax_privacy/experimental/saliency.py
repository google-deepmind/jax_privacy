"""DP saliency probe for parameter-selective DP fine-tuning.

Implements the discrete top-k voting probe of DP-SAPF (Gong, Li, Lin, Wang,
2026, "DP-SAPF: Saliency-Aware Parameter Fine-tuning of Public Models for
Differentially Private Image Synthesis", USENIX Security 2026,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.30312).

This helper is an LLM-oriented top-k voting adaptation of DP-SAPF rather than
a verbatim implementation of the paper's image-synthesis method. Prefer the
probe when a public pretrained model has many candidate parameter leaves and
saliency is expected to be concentrated in a small, stable subset, so the
one-time probe cost can be offset by a smaller downstream trainable set. A
standard all-candidate or default-LoRA baseline may be preferable when the
candidate set is already small, saliency is diffuse or unstable, or the
additional privacy and computation cost of the probe cannot be amortized.
Utility comparisons should use the same total privacy budget.

Per included privacy unit:
  * compute the per-sample gradient (via `jax_privacy.clipped_grad`)
  * restrict to a caller-provided set of candidate pytree leaves
  * take L2 norm per candidate leaf
  * vote +1 on the top-`vote_top_k` leaves

The vote vectors are summed across the caller-provided probe batch and Gaussian
noise is added directly to the histogram; the top `select_top_k` layers by
noisy vote count are the selected set. The probe runs once, separately from the
downstream jitted training step. Only its batched gradient computation is
jitted.

This low-level helper deliberately does not sample records or construct a
`dp_accounting.DpEvent`. The caller must use a sampling mechanism appropriate
for its privacy definition and account for that mechanism separately. For
example, one independent Poisson draw with probability `q` can be represented
by `accounting.dpsgd_event(noise_multiplier, 1, sampling_prob=q)`.

DP analysis: each included privacy unit contributes a vote vector in
`{0,1}^L` with exactly `vote_top_k` ones, so the L2 sensitivity under
ADD_OR_REMOVE is `sqrt(vote_top_k)`. Each unit must be independently sampled
if the caller claims Poisson amplification. The Gaussian noise added has stddev
`noise_multiplier * sqrt(vote_top_k)`, matching the standard convention that
`noise_multiplier` is expressed in units of sensitivity.

See `topk_vote_probe` for a runnable sampling and accounting example.

  """Runs the DP top-k voting probe and returns a selection mask.

  This is a one-time pre-training mechanism, separate from the downstream
  jitted training step. The function computes per-sample gradients via
  `jax_privacy.clipped_grad`, extracts a one-hot top-`vote_top_k` vote vector
  per example over the leaves selected by `candidate_mask`, sums the vote
  vectors, and adds Gaussian noise. The expensive clipped-gradient call is
  jitted. When requested, its built-in microbatching performs sequential
  accumulation.

  Sampling and privacy accounting are intentionally outside this low-level
  API. The caller must select the records in `dataset` and construct a
  `DpEvent` matching the actual sampling mechanism and `noise_multiplier`. For
  independent Poisson sampling under add-or-remove adjacency, use one
  Poisson-sampled Gaussian event. Without valid sampling amplification, account
  for the unsampled Gaussian mechanism instead. Sampling randomness, sampled
  indices, the realized Poisson batch size, and `prng_key` must not be released
  or predictable.

  Example:
    Probe a full synthetic batch without subsampling. The fixed noise seed is
    only for this demonstration; real noise randomness must remain private.

  Args:
    loss_fn: The loss, called as `loss_fn(params, batch)` by default. It must
      return a scalar, or `(loss, aux)` when `clipping_kwargs` sets
      `has_aux=True`. Auxiliary outputs are discarded before adding noise to
      the votes. Bind any arguments other than parameters and data in this
      callable.
    dataset: A single caller-selected batched pytree. Every leaf must have the
      same leading dimension.
    params: The model parameters (a pytree). Only used to compute gradients;
      not updated.
    vote_top_k: Per-sample voting width. Each sample votes +1 on this many
      candidate leaves. Determines the L2 sensitivity of the mechanism
      (`sqrt(vote_top_k)`).
    select_top_k: Number of candidate leaves to keep after ranking by noisy
      vote count. Must be `<= sum(candidate_mask)`.
    noise_multiplier: Gaussian noise stddev in units of the L2 sensitivity.
      The absolute per-bin stddev of the added noise is
      `noise_multiplier * sqrt(vote_top_k)`.
    candidate_mask: Boolean pytree with the same structure as `params`. Leaves
      set to `True` are considered candidates for selection. Non-candidate
      leaves get no votes and are `False` in the returned `selected_mask`.
    prng_key: Private, unpredictable PRNG key for the Gaussian noise.
    microbatch_size: The vmap width used internally by `clipped_grad`. The
      default `None` vectorizes over the entire batch. A positive integer
      reduces peak memory by accumulating microbatches sequentially; the input
      batch is padded automatically when necessary.
    clipping_kwargs: Optional keywords forwarded to `clipped_grad`, such as
      `has_aux` and `keep_batch_dim`. Set `keep_batch_dim=False` for a loss
      accepting a single example without a leading batch axis. Set `argnums=1`
      and `batch_argnums=0` for `loss_fn(batch, params)`. These default to 0 and
      1, respectively. Both must be integer argument positions for
      this two-argument callable. All auxiliary outputs are discarded. The
      probe reserves `l2_clip_norm`, `pre_clipping_transform`,
      `microbatch_size`, `normalize_by`, `rescale_to_unit_norm`, `grid_scale`,
      and `slack` to preserve its summed top-k vote mechanism.

  Returns:
    A `ProbeResult`.

  Raises:
