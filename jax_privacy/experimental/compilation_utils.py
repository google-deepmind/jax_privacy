  r"""Find a set of of compiled batch sizes that minimizes wasted compute.

  Given a list of batch sizes $B_1, ..., B_n$ and and a compilation budget,
  $C$, this function finds compiled batch sizes $M_1, ..., M_C$ that minimizes
  the following objective:

  $ L_(M_1, ..., M_C) = sum_{i=1}^n min_{j : M_j \geq B_i} (M_j - B_i) $

  The term M_j - B_i in this objective represents the wasted compute for
  evaluating gradients for a batch of size M_j when the true batch size is B_i.

  The time complexity of this function is $O(C * b^2)$ where $b$ is the number
  of unique batch sizes in the list. It is currently not highly optimized.

  Args:
    batch_sizes: A list of non-negative integers B_1, ..., B_n.
    num_compilations: A non-negative integer representing the number of unique
      batch sizes to return (and compile downstream functions for).

  Returns:
    A set of integers.
