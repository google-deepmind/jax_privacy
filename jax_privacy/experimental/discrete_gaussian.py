"""Utilities for sampling from the discrete Gaussian distribution.

This implements the sampling algorithm for the discrete Gaussian distribution
from the paper:
  Clement Canonne, Gautam Kamath, & Thomas Steinke
  "The Discrete Gaussian for Differential Privacy"
  NeurIPS 2020 https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010
Note that the implementation here is uses floating point arithmetic for
computing probabilities, which can result in small inaccuracies, but
not catastrophic failures. Roughly speaking, the floating point errors in
computing the probabilities are added to the delta term in differential privacy.

  """Computes the sampling parameters for the discrete Gaussian sampler.

  The discrete Gaussian sampling algorithm is correct for *any* choice of
  laplace_scale > 0 and oversample >= 1. However, the choice of parameters
  affects the efficiency of the algorithm.

  These parameter settings are tuned numerically to ensure good performance.
  First, laplace_scale is chosen so that the probability of accepting each
  sample in the rejection sampling step is >60%.
  Second, oversample is chosen to be large enough to ensure that if we generate
  oversample samples, then after rejection sampling we have at least size
  samples remaining with >95% probability. Thus the sampling algorithm will
  stop after one iteration with >95% probability.

  Args:
    sigma: Standard deviation proxy of the discrete Gaussian distribution.
    size: Size of the output array.

  Returns:
    A tuple of (laplace_scale, oversample) for the discrete Gaussian sampler.
    laplace_scale: The scale parameter of the Laplace distribution.
    oversample: The number of samples to draw before rejection sampling.
