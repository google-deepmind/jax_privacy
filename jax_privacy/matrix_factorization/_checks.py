  """Apply checks to matrices A = B @ C and X = C.T @ C.

  These checks are based on the current assumptions typical in this
  codebase, not on the most general possibilities allowed by the theory.
  For example, in full generality A need not be square, and B and C need
  not be lower triangular when they are square. However, these are the typical
  assumptions in this codebase, and hence we check these properties to err
  on the side of catching bugs; when needed these checks can always be removed
  in places that allow more general assumptions, or these checks can be updated.

  Any subset of the matrices can be provided.

  Args:
    A: The workload matrix.
    B: The B decoder matrix, such that A = B @ C.
    C: The encoder matrix.
    X: Symmetric matrix C.T @ C.
