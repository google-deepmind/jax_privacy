# Installation

**Note:** to ensure that your installation is compatible with your local
accelerators such as a GPU, we recommend to first follow the corresponding
instructions to install [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax#installation).

## Recommended: Install from GitHub Head

We **highly recommend** installing JAX Privacy directly from GitHub head.
The repository is under active development, and installing from head ensures
you get the most recent features and the best version of the library.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/jax_privacy
```

### Dependency versions

*   [**DP Accounting**](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/tree/main/python/dp_accounting):
    JAX Privacy and DP Accounting are co-developed — we often add features to
    DP Accounting and then surface them in JAX Privacy, so installing from head
    ensures consistency.

*   [**Optax**](https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax):
    Parts of JAX Privacy have been upstreamed to optax (optax.microbatching),
    and JAX Privacy depends on this recently-added code. Installing from head
    ensures updates to optax are reflected in JAX-Privacy.

## Alternative: Install from PyPI

You can also install JAX Privacy from PyPI (version 1.0 or 2.0), but note
that these releases will not have all the features available on GitHub head.

```
pip install jax-privacy
```

## Local Development Installation

This option is preferred if you want to build on top of our codebase or
contribute to the library.

*   The first step is to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/jax_privacy
```

*   Then the code can be installed. We recommend local installation so
    modifications to the code are reflected in imports of the package:

```
cd jax_privacy
pip install -e .
```
