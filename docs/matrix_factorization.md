# Matrix Factorization Notation

<!-- disableFinding(LINE_OVER_80) -->

{mod}`jax_privacy.matrix_factorization` implements correlated-noise
("DP-FTRL") mechanisms: define, optimize, instantiate, and apply a matrix
factorization of a workload. This page records the notation used by that
public API. For a runnable overview, see
[`dpmf_strategy_optimization.py`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/jax_privacy/blob/main/examples/dpmf_strategy_optimization.py).

The full name (left column) is generally used for kwargs on public functions.
Single-letter names appear in implementations and match the papers cited
below.

## Notation and symbols

| Full name / API name | Symbol or short name | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| `workload` | $A$ | Workload matrix, for example `np.tri` (the lower-triangular matrix of ones) for prefix sums. |
| `strategy_matrix` | $C$ | Strategy matrix, also sometimes called the encoder matrix. |
| `noising_matrix` | $C^{-1}$ or `C_inv` | In a factorization $A = BC$, the noise added on iteration $i$ is conceptually `(C_inv @ Z)[i, :]`. Production code usually applies this implicitly. |
| `decoder_matrix` | $B$ | Decoder matrix $B$ in the factorization $A = BC$. |
| `n` | $n$ | Number of iterations the mechanism supports, equal to the number of rows and columns in $A$. |
| `max_participations` | $k$ | Number of epochs, or maximum participations for one datum or user. |
| `min_sep` | $b$ | Used both for `num_bands` (banded matrices) and min-separation participation. |
| `sensitivity` | `sens` | L2 sensitivity of $C$ under a [participation schema](#participation-schemas). |
| `error` | `error` | Variance (squared error) of $C^{-1}$ under unit noise, ignoring sensitivity. |
| `loss` | `loss` | Total loss, including sensitivity: $\mathrm{loss}(C, B) = \mathrm{sens}(C)^2 \cdot \mathrm{error}(B)$. |

## Types of loss and error

By default the library operates on squared losses and errors.
`per_query_error` is the vector of errors for each query (row) of the
workload $A$. This is usually reduced to a scalar: `max_error` (maximum
per-query error) or `mean_error` (mean per-query error). Papers often report
`sqrt(mean_error)`, also called `rmse` (root-mean-squared error).

## Sensitivity and participation schemas

The L2 sensitivity of a matrix mechanism is a function of $C$. See
[Choquette-Choo et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06530) and
[Choquette-Choo et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08153).

Definitions are with respect to an abstract privacy unit. With appropriate
bundling (for example FedAvg-style), per-example notions convert to per-user
notions. This page may use `example`, `user`, and `datum` interchangeably
under that understanding.

Sensitivity depends on which iterations each example participates in:

| Name in code | Full name | Description |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| (implicit) | single-participation or single-epoch | Each example participates at most once in training. This is the default if unspecified. See [Denisov et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08312). |
| `min_sep` | $b$ min-separation | Examples are at least $b$ steps apart. If an example participates in iterations $i$ and $j$, then $\|i - j\| \ge b$. $(k, b)$-participation below is a special case. See [Choquette-Choo et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08153). |
| `fixed_epoch` | $(k, b)$ participation | There are exactly $n = k \cdot b$ iterations, and participations are separated by multiples of $b$: if a client participates on $i$ and $j$, then $\|i - j\| \bmod b = 0$. See [Choquette-Choo et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06530). |

## Parameterized matrix classes

Parameterizing $C$ and $C^{-1}$ makes sensitivity and error cheaper to
compute, and makes online noise generation efficient (for example in
DP-FTRL).

### General banded matrices

Implemented in {mod}`jax_privacy.matrix_factorization.banded`, introduced in
[Choquette-Choo et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08153).

A matrix $X$ is $b$-banded if $i, j \in [n]$ and $|i - j| \ge b$ implies
$X_{[i,j]} = 0$. This is off-by-one from the usual bandwidth ($X$ has
bandwidth $b-1$), but it matches $b$-banded matrices with $b$-min-separation
participation. For $b$-banded lower-triangular matrices, $b$ is the number of
bands.

### Banded Toeplitz matrices

Implemented in {mod}`jax_privacy.matrix_factorization.toeplitz`. $C \in
\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a lower-triangular Toeplitz matrix, parameterized
by `n` (the size of $C$) and `coef` (the nonzero Toeplitz coefficients of
$C$). See [McKenna (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15913).

TODO: b/329444015 - Add a markdown example where n = 4 and coef = [1, 0.5].

### Buffered linear Toeplitz (BLT) matrices

Implemented in {mod}`jax_privacy.matrix_factorization.buffered_toeplitz`. BLT
mechanisms were introduced in [Dvijotham et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16706)
and extended to multiple participations in
[Choquette-Choo et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08868).

### LTI Toeplitz matrices

These matrices are parameterized by a single constant $\nu$ that defines the
recursive relationship for each new entry in a column. They are not
optimized, though $\nu$ can be swept with respect to some error definition.
They are optimal for an LTI error definition. See
[Choquette-Choo et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06771).
